At the very least, another conversation about whether Mr. Trump bears any responsibility for today\u2019s toxic political environment is not what the party had in mind this close to Election Day.","13":"'Our highest national leaders are legitimizing rhetoric once confined to the paranoid extremes of our society,' he said in a statement.

Mr. Trump went to an Illinois campaign rally and denounced gun violence as 'evil' and called for unity, then criticized Hillary Clinton and Representative Maxine Waters (who were two targets of the pipe bomber).","10":"Mr. Trump himself does seem eager to move on. By late Saturday night, the president was tweeting about the World Series.","11":"The moment is complicated for Democrats, too.

His remarks on Friday and Saturday were striking for their limited empathy and for his decision to go beyond mourning and offer armchair analysis and conjecture.","20":"'We don\u2019t usually send you messages about other races,' the note read, 'but this is important.'","15":"'No, Mr. President, the synagogue is not at fault for being insufficiently armed,' he said.
