        "8": "Since fans knew of Lincoln's departure for a while, AMC made an unusual decision to heavily promote the episodes as the last time for viewers to see Rick Grimes. It may seem like a cynical strategy, but Rick Porter says it just might work\u00a0\u2014\u00a0in the short run at least.",

Critics\u00a0once again agreed that the death seemed unnecessary \u2014 included only for shock value\u00a0\u00a0\u2014 and many fans took to\u00a0social media to express their outrage.",

Maybe The Walking Dead is about to pull out another ace from its tattered, zombie-bitten sleeve.",
        "2": "It's an end of an\u00a0extraordinary arc that started with him opening his eyes in a hospital bed to learn the world as he knew\u00a0it was\u00a0gone, including the\u00a0loss of family, friends, and faith in his\u00a0moral compass.",
        "13": "",
        "14": "One of the reasons\u00a0it's so crucial for The Walking Dead to handle Grimes' death properly is that at least a part of the show's audience attrition\u00a0has to do with previous character deaths that fans felt were manipulative or done purely for shock value.",
        "7": "From Lincoln's penultimate episode, it seems pretty clear that his character will, in fact, die. Episode four saw him speared through the\u00a0abdomen, bleeding profusely, and surrounded by \"walkers\" (zombies in the vernacular of The Walking Dead). And given his leadership role and family ties to other key characters \u2014\u200b partner of Michonne, father to Judith \u2014 \u200bthe likelihood of him just going away to some other community seems slim.",
