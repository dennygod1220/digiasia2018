{"content":{"3":"Now, with Republicans desperate to reposition themselves and come up with their own health care pitch, and with the elections roiled by gale-force winds on immigration and Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation hearings, the question is whether health care will be enough to save her and Democrats in other key Senate races. Most recently, the mail bombs sent from Florida and the fatal synagogue shooting in Pittsburgh on Saturday have added jagged new pieces with the potential to further disrupt both parties\u2019 strategies.","9":"And on Friday, Mr. Obama, in speeches in Detroit and Milwaukee, mocked Republican ads on health care, accusing them of trying to rewrite history and their own positions after trying for years to repeal the Affordable Care Act.","23":"Democrats\u2019 reversal of fortune on health care astonishes former Senator Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, who lost her seat in the last midterm cycle, she believes, because of her vote for the Affordable Care Act in 2010.","21":"Two years ago, during the 2016 election, health care was featured in just 10 percent of Democrats\u2019 ads.","46":"'I\u2019m kind of ashamed of my country and the mess we made of Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s life,' she said. 'I probably would have voted for Claire until that happened.'","27":"National Democrats said the issue bubbled up this year from voters. In fact, the party was taken by surprise last year as Congress was swamped with phone calls and protesters when Republicans tried but failed to repeal the Affordable Care Act in a series of dramatic votes.","41":"For all the Democrats\u2019 focus, it is uncertain how the issue will influence voters.","28":"Just as the issue was fading a bit from voters\u2019 minds, Republicans in 20 states filed a lawsuit this year to overturn what remains of the law. In June, the Trump administration weighed in. Citing the president\u2019s approval, the Justice Department said it agreed with the need to end the health care law\u2019s guarantees that insurance companies could not deny coverage to people with pre-existing illnesses or charge them more.","18":"At the same time, her father-in-law, a lifelong Democrat, is leaning toward Mr. Hawley.","6":"Mr. Trump announced falsely last October he had already killed the Affordable Care Act, saying, 'It\u2019s dead. It\u2019s gone. It\u2019s no longer.' Senate Republicans introduced legislation in August they said would protect people with pre-existing conditions. But health experts say the bill would allow insurers to exclude services and treatment for certain pre-existing conditions.","20":"The midterms 'are officially about health care,' is the conclusion of the Wesleyan Media Project, whose analysis of television ads in congressional races found that nearly half include discussion of health care.","40":"In an interview on Saturday, after he had walked in the University of Missouri homecoming parade, Mr. Hawley, 38, said that his plan would cost only 'a fraction' of the Affordable Care Act. He attacked Ms. McCaskill for being unwilling to consider solutions that are not part of Obamacare. The 2010 law offset expenses for people with existing illnesses by requiring healthy people to buy insurance \u2014 a mandate since eliminated by Republicans.","45":"This year, however, she will not do so.","44":"Another voter, Karen French, a 59-year-old retired nurse, is part of the large bloc of conservatives who crossed party lines in the past to vote for Ms. McCaskill, one of only two Missouri Democrats in statewide office.","17":"Callie Glascock, an administrator at the University of Missouri who voted for Mr. Trump, said on Sunday she would cast a ballot for Ms. McCaskill, who is seeking a third term, because of health care. 'Everyone wants to say Obamacare was bad. Well, who\u2019s come up with a better plan?' she asked outside a market displaying a hay wagon of pumpkins in Ashland, Mo.","39":"Ms. McCaskill blasted it as 'a press release plan' in a debate last week. 'You can\u2019t go to court and get rid of important protections when there is no backup, when people will be in a free fall,' she said.","1":"COLUMBIA, Mo. \u2014 Senator Claire McCaskill isn\u2019t subtle in reminding voters what her campaign is all about. She\u2019s rechristened it the 'Your Health Care, Your Vote' tour.","36":"Mr. Hawley, as Missouri\u2019s attorney general, is a plaintiff in the multistate lawsuit that would terminate the Affordable Care Act altogether.","32":"Similarly, Senator Dean Heller of Nevada, the most vulnerable Republican seeking re-election, maintained in a debate last week that he helped write a 2017 bill protecting pre-existing conditions.","34":"Nowhere is the issue more important than in the close race in Missouri.","24":"Before the 2014 campaign season, Ms. Landrieu invited other red-state Democrats up for re-election to her Washington home to brainstorm about reforms they could propose without actually mentioning 'Obamacare.' They did not succeed.","7":"Nonetheless, Mr. Trump tweeted last week: 'Republicans will totally protect people with Pre-Existing Conditions, Democrats will not! Vote Republican.'","37":"Facing criticism on the issue, he recorded an ad in which he tells of learning that his 5-year-old son has a chronic disease and says he will force insurance companies to cover pre-existing conditions.","25":"Not only Ms. Landrieu but other Democrats were swept away that year in Arkansas, Alaska and North Carolina, handing Republicans the Senate majority.","2":"The turnaround could not be more startling. After years of running as far as they could from President Barack Obama\u2019s health care law, Ms. McCaskill and vulnerable Senate Democrats in Florida, West Virginia and other political battlegrounds have increasingly focused their closing argument on a single issue: saving the Affordable Care Act.","42":"John Kosach, a 32-year-old public relations researcher in a St. Louis suburb, said he supported Ms. McCaskill. 'Claire\u2019s message of saying Hawley is going to repeal the law but there isn\u2019t a plan in place, that\u2019s resonated with me,' he said.","35":"Ms. McCaskill, 65, recounts on the campaign trail how, when she was a young lawyer, her parents were forced to move in with her after her father lost his job and his insurance because of a brain tumor. 'I remember hearing my mother in the next room being very upset because she was so frightened,' she said at a rally last Friday.","29":"'They gave us the political gift of the cycle,' said Brad Woodhouse, executive director of Protect Our Care, an advocacy group on the left.","15":"Their claims come after years of lawsuits and congressional votes by Republicans to gut or weaken the health care law\u2019s protections of expensive chronic illnesses.","11":"But after years of trying and failing to rally voters behind the complicated features of Mr. Obama\u2019s health care law, Democrats have discovered this year the emotional power of one of its benefits, protecting people with pre-existing illnesses.","30":"Since then, Republicans in many close races have scrambled for cover, insisting that they, too, want to protect people with pre-existing conditions.","16":"In addition to fashioning a message on health care, Mr. Hawley is relying on a blunt appeal to partisanship. Asked about his campaign\u2019s closing message, Mr. Hawley\u2019s campaign manager, Kyle Plotkin, pointed to the slogan boldly emblazoned on the campaign bus: 'Stop Schumer. Fire Claire. Don\u2019t let the liberals take over.'","4":"Ms. McCaskill and her Republican opponent, the Missouri attorney general, Josh Hawley, clashed sharply over health care once again at their final debate on Thursday. She lambasted him for participating in a lawsuit that challenges the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act and would end its protections for those with pre-existing conditions. He said he supported a program that would protect patients with high medical costs outside the current health care law.","47":"Ms. French, who lives in rural Fulton, Mo., has a 28-year-old daughter who has severe problems with her heart and lungs. Asked if she was worried that Mr. Hawley\u2019s lawsuit would threaten protections for people like her daughter, Ms. French broke in before a reporter could finish the question.","43":"His wife, Sam Kosach, 31, who also works in public relations, said Mr. Hawley\u2019s use of his family in the ad about his support for pre-existing conditions 'just felt icky.'","13":"'This is the message coming straight from people in the red states,' said Senator Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, chairman of the Democrats\u2019 Senate campaign committee.","26":"'The truth is finally winning out,' Ms. Landrieu said of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s increasing popularity in polls. 'It didn\u2019t happen fast enough for us.'","19":"'He said, You know what, after watching all that Judge Kavanaugh stuff, he\u2019s about changed his mind on voting Democrat,' said his son, Mike Glascock, who was also at the market. 'He just hated all that rhetoric.'","10":"It is unknown whether Democrats\u2019 health care message will hold up as Mr. Trump, through almost daily rallies and frequent Twitter blasts, tries to dominate television news and social media in the campaign\u2019s final days. He has said the midterms would be about 'Kavanaugh, the caravan, law and order, and common sense.'","8":"[Read about the political motivations of people who recently made their first donations to an election campaign.]","33":"Yet the Republican bills watered down or eliminated the protections in existing law. They would have allowed states to receive waivers to let insurers charge higher premiums for unhealthy people.","48":"'It doesn\u2019t matter to me,' she said. 'More important is the situation that happened with Judge Kavanaugh.'","5":"On the same day, President Trump proposed that Medicare pay for certain prescription drugs based on the prices paid in other industrialized countries \u2014 one recent initiative coming from the White House and Republicans after years of campaigning on killing the Affordable Care Act without offering a replacement that would include comparable protections for people with pre-existing medical conditions.","22":"A survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation last week found that in two battleground states, Florida and Nevada, nearly seven in 10 voters support protecting people with pre-existing conditions even if it means healthy people would pay more.","12":"The subject has lit up polls, monopolized advertising budgets and driven a national strategy for Democrats, who are defending 10 Senate seats in states President Trump won and are relying heavily on health care as a defining issue in key states including Arizona, Florida, West Virginia and Nevada.","38":"In a newspaper column, Mr. Hawley proposed that the federal government pay expenses above $10,000 for people with pre-existing conditions. His plan included no details on how the government would raise the money to cover these costs.","31":"Two Republican House members running for Senate in battleground states, Representatives Martha McSally of Arizona and Kevin Cramer of North Dakota, argued they voted for Obamacare repeal-and-replace bills in 2017 that would have protected people with pre-existing conditions.","14":"Republicans have been put on the defensive, insisting in TV ads featuring their family members that they, too, support affordable care for people with pre-existing conditions."},"keywords":"republican,hawley,pre,democrat,health,care,mccaskill,person,condition,exist","link":"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2018\/10\/28\/us\/politics\/health-care-elections-democrats.html?partner=rss&emc=rss","title":"To Rally Voters, Democrats Focus on Health Care as Their Closing Argument"}
