Eleven worshipers were killed in the attack.","23":"'Coming to the U.S. is the biggest miracle of my life, and it\u2019s thanks to HIAS,' said Ms. Sostrin, 48, who is married with two children, 11 and 9.","10":"In another post, he wrote: 'You like to bring in hostile invaders to dwell among us?

Its clients have often been Jews \u2014 its first mission was to aid those fleeing pogroms in Eastern Europe \u2014 but the agency has also helped resettle many other kinds of refugees, including thousands of Vietnamese, Cambodians and Laotians after Communist victories in Southeast Asia in the 1970s.","1":"When Mazen Hasan had to flee his native Iraq because his work for the American military had drawn threats on his life, it was a Jewish refugee resettlement agency called HIAS that helped him and his family to settle in Pittsburgh.","5":"[The mayor called Saturday\u2019s attack the 'darkest day of Pittsburgh\u2019s history.']","25":"'We are happy with the life we have here, which the Jewish agency helped us start,' said Mr. Hasan, who is an observant Muslim.

On Saturday night, after the attack on the synagogue in Pittsburgh, she said, 'Evil, hatred and racism will not keep justice and mercy from prevailing.'","22":"The family arrived in Minneapolis in 1988.
