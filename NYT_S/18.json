{"keywords":"official,company,taxpayer,administration,government,secretary,trump,hotel,lobbyist,president","content":{"44":"And Price, the former health secretary, spent hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars on private planes. His history of unethical stock trading didn\u2019t keep Trump from naming Price to the cabinet. But the private-plane scandal received enough attention that the White House eventually forced Price to resign.","13":"During Trump\u2019s presidency, his companies have pushed to expand overseas, with help from foreign governments. One example: In May, an Indonesian real-estate project that involves the Trump Organization reportedly received a $500 million loan from a company owned by the Chinese government. Two days later, Trump tweeted that he was working to lift sanctions on a Chinese telecommunications firm with close ties to the government \u2014 over the objections of both Republicans and Democrats in Congress. He ultimately did lift the sanctions.","38":"Paul Manafort, Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman, reportedly used his position to offer private briefings to a Russian oligarch to whom he owed millions of dollars. Manafort saw the briefings as a way to 'get whole.'","5":"Compiling the list made us understand why some historians believe Trump\u2019s administration is the most corrupt since at least Warren Harding\u2019s, of 1920s Teapot Dome fame. Trump administration officials and people close to them are brashly using power to amass perks and cash. They are betting that they can get away with it. So far, Congress has let them.","25":"The president and his aides have repeatedly shown they are willing to use the government\u2019s prestige and power to help their friends and relatives make money.","51":"What\u2019s missing from this list? If you think there are other examples that should appear on this list, email us at leonhardt@nytimes.com.","34":"Brenda Fitzgerald, the former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, committed a more mild version of this sin. She purchased shares in food, drug and tobacco companies after taking charge of an agency that regulates them \u2014 and that aims to reduce smoking. After her purchases became public, she resigned.","23":"The Education Department during the Obama administration aggressively regulated for-profit colleges \u2014 many of which have miserable records, often taking money from students without providing a useful education. Trump chose Betsy DeVos, a longtime advocate of these colleges and an investor in them, as his education secretary. She, not surprisingly, has gone easy on for-profit colleges. Among other moves, she has reassigned the members of an department team investigating potentially fraudulent activities at for-profit colleges.","50":"Yet the current congressional leaders \u2014 the Republican leaders \u2014 have refused to do so. They have shirked their duty to act as a check on the president and his appointees. They have instead defended Trump and made excuses on his behalf. They have enabled the most corrupt administration of our lifetimes.","10":"The Constitution forbids federal officials from accepting gifts, known as emoluments, from foreign powers, unless they have received congressional approval. Congressional Democrats have sued Trump for violating this clause, and the case is now in federal court.","21":"The president personally intervened in a plan to relocate the F.B.I.\u2019s Washington headquarters, apparently to protect Trump International Hotel, which is about a block away. If the F.B.I. had moved, its current site would most likely have been turned into a commercial development, and the long construction process \u2014 as well as potential for a new hotel on the site \u2014 could have hurt the Trump hotel.","3":"There\u2019s a word for this: corruption.","42":"Brock Long, the head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, spent $151,000 on government vehicles without authorization, including to travel to his North Carolina home. He was ordered to repay the government.","8":"A few days after the 2016 election, the government of Kuwait canceled a planned event at the Four Seasons Hotel. It instead held the event \u2014 a celebration of Kuwait\u2019s National Day \u2014 at the Trump International Hotel in Washington.","16":"The Kushner company also successfully lobbied the Qatari government to invest in 666 Fifth Avenue, a financially troubled luxury building. The company\u2019s dealings with Middle Eastern countries are especially problematic because Jared Kushner is one of the administration\u2019s top policymakers for the region and has played a central role in policy toward Qatar.","29":"Scott Pruitt, the former E.P.A. head, asked his staff members to contact Republicans donors with the goal of helping his wife find a job. Pruitt also rented a condo on Capitol Hill for $50 a night, well below market value, from the wife of an energy lobbyist whose project the E.P.A. approved last March. Pruitt\u2019s many scandals led to his resignation in July.","52":"Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter (@NYTopinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.","14":"Trump\u2019s businesses have also moved to expand in India, the Dominican Republic and Indonesia, using deals directly with foreign governments.","6":"[Listen to 'The Argument' podcast every Thursday morning with Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt.]","2":"President Trump, his family and more than a few of his appointees are using his presidency to enrich themselves. They are spending taxpayer dollars for their own benefit. They are accepting sweetheart deals from foreigners. And they are harnessing the power of the federal government on behalf of their businesses.","7":"Here\u2019s the list, sorted into thematic categories:","32":"Several Trump officials \u2014 current and former \u2014 have traded stocks while serving in top government positions. In some cases, they appear to have made policy decisions benefiting the companies in which they owned a stake.","37":"Corey Lewandowski, the former manager of Trump\u2019s campaign, is paid for work that looks very much like lobbying \u2014 such as participating in a lobbying firm\u2019s phone calls with clients and doing work on behalf of T-Mobile, the telecommunications company firm. But Lewandowski has not registered as a lobbyist and says he does not need to do so.","30":"Elaine Chao, the transportation secretary, used interviews with Chinese and Chinese-American media to raise her father\u2019s profile. He is a shipping magnate whose business transports goods between the United States and Asia, and he sat next to her during the interviews.","48":"The biggest scandal of all, however, is not even the corruption of the Trump administration. It\u2019s the inaction of Congress.","36":"Michael Cohen \u2014 Trump\u2019s former lawyer and fixer, who has since turned on him \u2014 received at least $1 million from AT&T, Novartis and Korea Aerospace Industries shortly after the 2016 election. They were supposedly paying for his insight into the Trump administration.","24":"DeVos is the most blatant example of administration officials protecting companies where they once worked, but there are many others. More than 164 former lobbyists work in the administration, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, including several who regulate the industries that once paid their salaries. Geoff Burr, who pushed for more lax workplace safety laws when he was the chief lobbyist for a construction group, now works at the Department of Labor. Andrew Wheeler, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, was previously a lobbyist whose firm was paid millions of dollars by companies whose industries he now regulates.","19":"Trump has visited or stayed at one of his properties almost one out of every three days that he has been president, according to both The Wall Street Journal and NBC News. Like previous presidents, Trump travels with a large group of staff and security personnel, and American taxpayers typically foot at least part of the bill for the trips. Unlike previous presidents, Trump is directing money to his own business on his trips.","18":"These moves are intended, at least partly, to bring attention and ultimately customers to Trump\u2019s businesses. Of course, some of Trump\u2019s critics have responded in kind, refusing to stay at or live in a Trump-branded property since he won the election. But in other ways, the presidency has clearly helped his bottom line. One example: The Mar-a-Lago club has doubled its membership rates.","4":"Given how widespread Trumpian corruption has become, we thought it was time to make a list. It\u2019s meant to be a definitive list of self-dealing by the president, his family, his staff or his friends \u2014 since he began running for president. To qualify, an incident needs to seem highly credible, even if it remains unresolved, and needs to involve making money.","15":"Jared Kushner, Trump\u2019s son-in-law and a top aide, has also reportedly been using his position to help his family business \u2014 Kushner Companies, also a real-estate company. Kushner\u2019s sister, Nicole Meyer, has bragged about the company\u2019s high-level ties when trying to attract Chinese investment in a New Jersey apartment complex. The Kushners have wooed Chinese investors despite warnings from American counterintelligence officials that China is using the investments to sway Trump administration policy.","31":"And although it doesn\u2019t quite rise to the same level of the other examples here: White House staffers receive a discount of up to 70 percent on Trump-branded merchandise at the president\u2019s Bedminster, N.J., golf club, reportedly at the president\u2019s recommendation.","28":"Ben Carson, the housing and urban development secretary, let his son help organize an official department event and invite people with whom the son had potential business dealings.","22":"Trump stopped this plan, and the White House has instead decided to build a new F.B.I. headquarters on the current site. A report by the inspector general found that officials gave misleading answers to Congress about Trump\u2019s role and the project\u2019s cost.","11":"American officials and business leaders have also spent money at Trump properties, sometimes in an apparent effort to please the president. Gov. Paul LePage of Maine last year stayed at the Trump International Hotel in Washington. Other Republicans have held campaign fund-raisers and party events at the properties. So have corporate lobbyists.","47":"It has shirked its constitutional duty.","43":"Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, looked into whether he could use a military plane to fly him to Europe for his honeymoon. Later, he used military planes for several trips. The Treasury Department\u2019s inspector general concluded that Mnuchin broke no laws by doing so, but criticized Mnuchin\u2019s insufficient explanation for why he needed to spend $800,000 on the trips.","1":"They don\u2019t even try very hard to hide it.","49":"The founders were well aware that the government they were creating could end up with corrupt or unethical leaders, all the way up to the president. That\u2019s why the Constitution gives Congress tremendous power to investigate and even remove officials in the executive branch.","9":"That celebration fits a pattern. Officials from foreign governments have realized they can curry favor with Trump by spending money at his properties. The list of governments includes Saudi Arabia, Malaysia, Bahrain, Azerbaijan, Turkey, China, India, Afghanistan and Qatar. Some may have done so even if he were not the president, but others are well aware of what they are doing.","46":"Zinke, the interior secretary, spent $139,000 in taxpayer money on new doors for his office. Carson, the secretary of health and human services, picked out a dining set for his office that cost $31,000 \u2014 and then gave Congress contradictory explanations for the purchase and blamed it on his wife. Pruitt ordered a $43,000 soundproof phone booth installed in his office and appears to have violated federal law by failing to inform Congress about it.","27":"Trump suggested to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan during a meeting at Mar-a-Lago in February 2017 that Abe grant a coveted operating license to a casino company owned by Sheldon Adelson, who donated at least $20 million to Trump\u2019s presidential campaign.","33":"Tom Price, Trump\u2019s first secretary of health and human services, epitomized this form of corruption. Trump chose him despite his history of using his seat in Congress to make money. Price had a long record of putting the interests of drug companies above those of taxpayers and patients \u2014 and then investing in those drug companies on the side.","40":"David Shulkin, the secretary of veterans affairs, charged taxpayers for a trip to Europe that included stopovers at Wimbledon and Westminster Abbey, plus a river cruise for him and his wife. The resulting outcry appears to have played a role in his departure.","45":"The pettiest kind of Trumpian corruption takes the form of interior decorating.","41":"Pruitt, the former head of the E.P.A., chartered flights for questionable travel, among many other things. He also pushed to fly Delta rather than the government\u2019s contract carrier, to accrue frequent flier miles. He flew first class and stayed in hotels that were more expensive than those allowed by government standards. And he let lobbyists help arrange foreign trips for him.","39":"Trump officials have made a habit of billing American taxpayers for their personal travel. Ryan Zinke, Trump\u2019s secretary of the interior, chartered a $12,000 flight to fly out of Las Vegas, where he had given a 12-minute speech to a hockey team owned by a businessman who donated to his congressional campaign.","12":"'National Railroad Construction and Maintenance Association Dinner at the Trump Hotel where I am drinking Trump coffee,' Senator Chuck Grassley, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, posted on Instagram last year.","17":"The president has played golf at his properties dozens of times since taking office. He refers to his Florida resort, Mar-a-Lago, as the winter White House. Shortly after his election, he celebrated New Year\u2019s along with 800 guests there, with tickets costing more than $500. And Kellyanne Conway, a top Trump adviser, once encouraged people to buy clothes from Ivanka Trump\u2019s line \u2014 while Conway was giving a television interview from the White House.","35":"Finally, Wilbur Ross, Trump\u2019s commerce secretary, has mixed government business and his own business in multiple ways. He held on to investments \u2014 and then appears to have lied to government ethics officials about those investments. He shorted the stock of a company about which he appeared to have advance notice of bad news. He also met with the chief executive of Chevron, even though his wife owned a substantial investment \u2014 which, according to Forbes, 'put himself at risk of violating a criminal conflict-of-interest law.'","20":"In one three-month period last year, the Secret Service spent about $63,000 at Mar-a-Lago and more than $137,000 on golf carts at Trump\u2019s Florida and New Jersey clubs.","26":"Among the examples:"},"link":"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2018\/10\/28\/opinion\/trump-administration-corruption-conflicts.html?partner=rss&emc=rss","title":"Trump\u2019s Corruption: The Definitive List"}
