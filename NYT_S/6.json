{"content":{"3":"He won by tapping into a deep well of resentment at the status quo in Brazil \u2014 a country whiplashed by rising crime and two years of political and economic turmoil \u2014 and by presenting himself as the alternative.","9":"Hundreds of supporters gathered outside Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s seaside home in Rio de Janeiro, jumping and hugging each other when the results were announced. As golden fireworks lit up the sky, they chanted 'mito,' or legend, paying homage to their president-elect.","23":"Yet, the vitriol and outrage Mr. Bolsonaro brought to the campaign trail as he traveled around the country largely mirrored Brazilians\u2019 dystopian mood.","21":"Mr. Bolsonaro, the patriarch of a family from Rio de Janeiro that includes three sons who are also lawmakers, ran an insurgent campaign that defied the political playbook that brought his predecessors to power.","27":"'Violence must be reduced because otherwise we are headed toward total chaos,' said Roberto Levi, 36, a police officer in Rio de Janeiro who voted for Mr. Bolsonaro.","41":"For the Workers\u2019 Party, Sunday\u2019s presidential defeat leaves a political movement that won accolades from much of population for affirmative action and inequality-reducing policies significantly weakened and effectively leaderless.","28":"Over the past two years, while many of Brazil\u2019s traditional political parties and powerful kingmakers were busy defending themselves against corruption allegations stemming from the investigation known as Lava Jato, Mr. Bolsonaro flew around the country, drumming up support, particularly among young men, and in comparatively wealthier and whiter parts of the country.","18":"And for those Brazilians who saw the political establishment they inherited from the Workers\u2019 Party as venal, Mr. Bolsonaro was an enthralling candidate.","6":"Mr. Bolsonaro, who will take the helm of Latin America\u2019s biggest nation, is farther to the right than any president in the region, where voters have recently embraced more conservative leaders in Argentina, Chile, Peru, Paraguay and Colombia. He joins a number of far-right politicians who have risen to power around world, including Italy\u2019s deputy prime minister, Matteo Salvini, and Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n of Hungary.","20":"'The way he\u2019s run his campaign is very clever,' said Matias Spektor, a professor of international relations at Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Getulio Vargas University. 'He has managed to align himself with the institutions that Brazilians still believe in: religion, family and armed forces.'","40":"'Those red good-for-nothings will be banished from the homeland,' he said during an address, delivered via a video link up, to thousands of supporters gathered in S\u00e3o Paulo. 'It will be a cleanup the likes of which has never been seen in Brazilian history.'","45":"'The Workers\u2019 Party strategy was centered too much around Lula and too little around thinking about the future of the country and about winning this election,' he said. 'An important part of the Brazilian electorate would have voted for the P.T. if it had drawn a line in the sand and renounced the corruption of the past.'","44":"During his campaign, Mr. Haddad visited Mr. da Silva in prison multiple times, and did little to take responsibility for the party\u2019s mistakes. This lack of atonement pushed many hesitant Brazilians toward Mr. Bolsonaro, said Mr. Mainwaring, the Harvard professor.","19":"He accomplished little in his long legislative career, but his roster of offensive remarks \u2014 he said that he\u2019d rather his son die than be gay and that women don\u2019t deserve the same pay as men \u2014 was interpreted by many as bracing honesty and evidence of his willingness to shatter the status quo.","17":"Despite his influence, Mr. da Silva was not able to pull off the last-minute transfer of votes to the candidate chosen to replace him on the ballot, the bookish and urbane \u2014 but less charismatic \u2014 Fernando Haddad.","39":"Last Sunday, he issued a threat to members of the Workers\u2019 Party that critics called downright fascist.","1":"RIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 Brazil on Sunday became the latest country to drift toward the far right, electing a strident populist as president in the nation\u2019s most radical political change since democracy was restored more than 30 years ago.","36":"In the wake of the attack, Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s standing in the polls rose steadily after languishing in the low 20-percent range for weeks. Last-minute endorsements from the influential evangelical lobby and agribusiness leaders gave him a boost.","32":"One dominant message, spread widely via WhatsApp, asserted with no evidence that Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s opponents encouraged schoolchildren to become gay or reconsider their gender identity by employing sex education materials referred to as 'gay kits.'","34":"Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s presidential ambition nearly ended on Sept. 6 when a man sliced a knife into his stomach during a campaign rally, slashing several organs and his intestines.","26":"He vowed to give the police forces in Brazil \u2014 some of the most lethal in the world \u2014 expanded authority to kill suspected criminals, saying with trademark bluntness that a 'good criminal is a dead criminal.' He also promised to lower the age of criminal responsibility, impose stiffer sentences for violent crimes and ease Brazil\u2019s gun ownership restrictions so civilians could better protect themselves.","7":"'This is a really radical shift,' said Scott Mainwaring, a professor at Harvard University\u2019s Kennedy School of Government who specializes in Brazil. 'I can\u2019t think of a more extremist leader in the history of democratic elections in Latin America who has been elected.'","37":"After the first round of voting, in which Mr. Bolsonaro received just shy of the 50 percent required to win outright, some political analysts expected he would moderate his rhetoric in order to appeal to centrist or undecided voters.","25":"Part of Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s appeal lay in the extreme solutions he proposed to assuage the population\u2019s anger and fear of violence.","2":"The new president, Jair Bolsonaro, has exalted the country\u2019s military dictatorship, advocated torture and threatened to destroy, jail or drive into exile his political opponents.","42":"Party luminaries hoped that the former president, Mr. da Silva, a lion of Latin America\u2019s left know by his nickname of 'Lula,' would return to the presidential palace. Even after Mr. da Silva was jailed, party leaders said that 'an election without Lula is fraud.'","35":"After that, Mr. Bolsonaro declined to participate in debates and did few probing interviews, leaving significant gaps in the electorate\u2019s understanding of his position on pivotal issues, including pension reform and the privatization of state enterprises.","29":"While rivals spent small fortunes on marketing firms, video editors and consultants, Mr. Bolsonaro relied primarily on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and the instant messaging service WhatsApp to communicate with voters and expand his base.","11":"Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s victory caps a bitter contest that divided families, tore friendships apart and ignited concerns about the resilience of Brazil\u2019s young democracy.","30":"Opponents enjoyed far more advertising time on television and radio \u2014 which is allotted by party size \u2014 and rolled out slickly edited campaign materials. But Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s campaign drowned them out with a bare-bones, scrappy communications strategy. He and his sons broadcast shaky, poorly-lit videos on Facebook and Instagram in which Mr. Bolsonaro cracked jokes, took aim at adversaries and bemoaned the state of Brazil.","16":"But many more Brazilians showed through their votes that they\u2019d had enough of the Workers\u2019 Party, which steered the country from 2003 to 2016 through a boom-and-bust cycle that ended in an economic morass and the impeachment of his successor, President Dilma Rousseff.","4":"'We have everything need to become a great nation,' Mr. Bolsonaro said Sunday night shortly after the race was called in a video broadcast on his Facebook account. 'Together we will change the destiny of Brazil.'","43":"When courts made clear Mr. da Silva would not be allowed to run, and the Workers\u2019 Party nominated Mr. Haddad, a former education minister and mayor of S\u00e3o Paulo, the campaign\u2019s slogan was 'Haddad is Lula.'","13":"Mr. Bolsonaro, 63, a former Army captain who has been a member of Congress for nearly three decades, beat a crowded field of presidential contenders, several of whom entered the race with bigger war chests, less baggage, and the backing of powerful political parties.","24":"Nearly 13 million people are unemployed. The homicide rate is among the highest in the world \u2014 last year, 63,880 people were killed. And Mr. da Silva, the former president many had idolized, had left office with an approval rating of 87 percent only to become the most prominent scalp taken by a corruption scandal that has ensnared dozens of the country\u2019s political and business leaders.","15":"His Workers\u2019 Party had won the last four presidential elections, and Mr. da Silva, a former metalworker, retained a devoted following among poor and working class Brazilians who felt represented by him personally and had benefited from his party\u2019s social inclusion policies.","10":"Reeling from the deepest recession in the country\u2019s history, a corruption scandal that tarnished politicians across the ideological spectrum, and a record-high number of homicides last year, Brazilians picked a candidate who not only rejected the political establishment but at times also seemed to reject the most basic democratic tenets.","8":"With 98 percent of votes counted, Mr. Bolsonaro was ahead with 55 percent, guaranteeing him a win over Fernando Haddad of the leftist Workers\u2019 Party, who had 45 percent.","33":"'I like what Bolsonaro stands for,' said Cintia Puerta, 55, an architect in S\u00e3o Paulo said Sunday after casting her vote. 'My sister works in a school so I know they are teaching 'gay kits' to children, teaching them about sexuality at age five and six. They\u2019re indoctrinating children in the school.'","5":"He appeared eager to dispel concerns that he would govern despotically, saying his government would be a 'defender of the Constitution, democracy and liberty.'","22":"A year ago, Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s bid was widely regarded by political veterans in Bras\u00edlia as fanciful in a nation renowned for the cordiality and warmth of its people. Some of the candidate\u2019s remarks were so offensive the country\u2019s attorney general earlier this year charged him with inciting hatred toward black, gay and indigenous people. In a country where most of the population is not white, this alone might have seemed to disqualify him.","12":"Many Brazilians see authoritarian tendencies in Mr. Bolsonaro, who plans to appoint military leaders to top posts and said he would not accept the result if he were to lose. He has threatened to stack the Supreme Court by increasing the number of judges to 21 from 11 and to deal with political foes by giving them the choice of extermination or exile.","38":"They were wrong.","31":"On WhatsApp, supporters created hundreds of groups to share memes, videos and messages that often contained falsehoods and misleading content that cast Mr. Bolsonaro in a positive light and disparaged his rivals.","14":"Part of the reason for his victory was the collapse of the left. Many cried foul after former President Luiz In\u00e1cio da Silva, the longtime front-runner in the race, was ruled ineligible to run after he was imprisoned in April to start serving a 12-year sentence for corruption and money laundering."},"keywords":"country,brazilian,bolsonaro,party,political,silva,haddad,worker,lula,brazil","link":"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2018\/10\/28\/world\/americas\/jair-bolsonaro-brazil-election.html?partner=rss&emc=rss","title":"Jair Bolsonaro, Far-Right Populist, Elected President of Brazil"}
