        "14": "One of the reasons\u00a0it's so crucial for The Walking Dead to handle Grimes' death properly is that at least a part of the show's audience attrition\u00a0has to do with previous character deaths that fans felt were manipulative or done purely for shock value.",

And given his leadership role and family ties to other key characters \u2014\u200b partner of Michonne, father to Judith \u2014 \u200bthe likelihood of him just going away to some other community seems slim.",

        "15": "It began with fan favourite Glenn Rhee (played by Steven Yeun), who appeared to be killed in season six only to be revealed as alive many episodes later. Then he was\u00a0brutally killed by villain Negan\u00a0at the beginning of season seven (but not before making the audience wait the whole summer to find out who was on\u00a0the receiving end of Negan's barbed bat).",
        "20": "The current season has been\u00a0almost unanimously praised by critics for returning to the values that made it a hit in the first place: a focus on interpersonal relationships, loyalties and betrayals. Many attribute this shift to the new show runner, Angela Kang.",

        "8": "Since fans knew of Lincoln's departure for a while, AMC made an unusual decision to heavily promote the episodes as the last time for viewers to see Rick Grimes. It may seem like a cynical strategy, but Rick Porter says it just might work\u00a0\u2014\u00a0in the short run at least.",
